In JavaScript, write a function that checks for the validity of a string given the following rules:
 
  1. There are 15 valid characters: the lower-case letters ‘a’ through ‘j’ 
     and the uppercase letters ‘Z’, ‘N’, ‘L’, ‘Q’, and ‘R’.
  2. Every valid lower-case letter by itself is valid, for example, ‘j’ is a valid string.
  3. If ϴ is a valid string, then so is Zϴ.
  4. If ϴ and τ are valid strings, then so are Nϴτ , Lϴτ , Qϴτ , and Rϴτ .
  5. All other strings are invalid.
 
The function should accept a parameter that consists of potential strings separated by whitespace 
and it would return one line per potential strings, followed by ‘VALID’ if the string passes 
the rules set above or ‘INVALID’ if it doesn't.
