Instructions for running:

1.) Site Mock:
	- Load the HTML file in a browser from the "./Mock" subdirectory.
	- Note: I didn't use external libraries (e.g. Bootstrap) when developing it, because I wasn't sure if they were against the requirements.


2.) JS Problem
	- The algorithm contents are in "./JS-Problem/solution.js" file.
	- If you have NodeJS installed, you can run a quick unit test run that I've put together with the command
	 "node ./tests.js".
